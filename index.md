Lightning IOT, as a plugin, for everybody!
( LNBits / Umbrel / BTCPay / Raspiblitz etcâ€¦)<br><br>

<br>
As seen before with projects like Pollofeed and Ben Arc bitcoin IOT tutoriels,  Lightning seems to be a very nice base for (almost) instant online payments that trigger something in real life . <br>
I'd like everybody to be able to set up something similar, with a few clicks! <br>
It seems like the easy and scaleable way to achieve that is using LNBits.  Plugin that use the attached Lightning node to manage payments, combined with a hardware device like an ESP32 board or a M5Stack.


The goal is to provide a lightweight, cheap and easy to integrate<br> base system that controls a 5V relay on a ESP32/M5Stack board when a Lightning payment is made.
<br><br>
**Requirements:**
- Bitcoin & Lightning Network <br>
- LNBits installed<br>
- ESP32 or M5Stack board
